Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as Dog_02.jpg


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, the three model architecture correctly classify the Coffee_mug_01.jpg and Frog_01.jpg to not be dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: All the model architectures has 100 percent accuracy of prediction. However compared to other model architecture VGG used a loner runtime to classify the images and so probably more computational power. Thus, AlEXNET & RESNET performed better
